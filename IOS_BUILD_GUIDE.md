# iOS Build and Installation Guide
## Racing Game 3D Mobile

This guide will help you build and install the Racing Game 3D on your iPhone.

---

## Prerequisites

### Required Software
1. **macOS Computer** (with macOS 11 Big Sur or later)
2. **Xcode 14+** - Download from the Mac App Store
3. **Xcode Command Line Tools**
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
4. **CMake 3.18+**
   ```bash
   brew install cmake
   ```

### Required Hardware
- iPhone or iPad running iOS 13.0 or later
- USB cable to connect device to Mac
- Apple ID (free account is sufficient for development)

---

## Step 1: Transfer Project to Mac

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: iOS apps can **only** be built on macOS with Xcode. The Xcode project file (`.xcodeproj`) cannot be generated on Linux or Windows.

If you're working on this project in a cloud environment or non-Mac computer:

1. **Download the entire project** from your repository
2. **Transfer to your Mac** via:
   - Git clone on your Mac: `git clone [your-repo-url]`
   - Direct download and copy
   - Cloud storage (iCloud, Dropbox, etc.)
   - Network transfer: `scp -r project-folder user@mac:~/`

**Note**: If you run `./build_ios.sh` on Linux/Windows, it will prepare the project files and provide instructions for building on macOS, but it cannot generate the actual Xcode project.

---

## Step 2: Generate Xcode Project

Open Terminal on your Mac and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/RacingGame3D
./build_ios.sh
```

This will:
- Generate an Xcode project in `ios/build/RacingGame3DiOS.xcodeproj`
- Configure all necessary iOS frameworks
- Set up proper build settings

---

## Step 3: Open in Xcode

```bash
open ios/build/RacingGame3DiOS.xcodeproj
```

Or double-click the `.xcodeproj` file in Finder.

---

## Step 4: Configure Code Signing

### 4.1 Add Your Apple ID
1. In Xcode, go to **Xcode ‚Üí Preferences** (or Settings)
2. Click **Accounts** tab
3. Click **+** button and add your Apple ID
4. Sign in with your credentials

### 4.2 Set Development Team
1. Select the **RacingGame3DiOS** project in the left sidebar
2. Select the **RacingGame3DiOS** target
3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. Check **Automatically manage signing**
5. Select your **Team** from the dropdown (your Apple ID)

### 4.3 Fix Bundle Identifier (if needed)
If you see signing errors:
1. Change the **Bundle Identifier** to something unique
2. Format: `com.yourname.racinggame3d`
3. Xcode will automatically create a provisioning profile

---

## Step 5: Connect Your iPhone

### 5.1 Physical Connection
1. Connect your iPhone to Mac via USB cable
2. Unlock your iPhone
3. Tap **Trust** when prompted on iPhone
4. Enter your iPhone passcode if requested

### 5.2 Select Your Device
1. In Xcode, at the top near the Run button
2. Click the device selector (should say "RacingGame3DiOS > Any iOS Device")
3. Select your iPhone from the list

---

- Clean build folder: Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder (‚áß‚åòK)

### Issue: "iPhone is not available"
**Solution**:
- Make sure iPhone is unlocked
- Trust the computer on iPhone
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting USB cable
- Update Xcode if your iPhone is running newer iOS

### Issue: "Could not locate device support files"

## Building for Distribution (Optional)

If you want to share the game with others:

### Option 1: TestFlight (Requires Apple Developer Program - $99/year)
1. Archive the app: Product ‚Üí Archive
2. Upload to App Store Connect
3. Add beta testers
4. They can install via TestFlight app

### Option 2: Ad Hoc Distribution (Requires Apple Developer Program)

2. Export with Ad Hoc distribution
3. Share .ipa file with specific device UDIDs

### Option 3: Development Install (Free, but limited)
- Anyone can install on their device using their own Apple ID
- They need Xcode and to follow this guide
- App expires after 7 days and needs reinstalling

## Performance Tips

### For Best Performance on iPhone:
1. **Close background apps** before playing
2. **Enable Low Power Mode** for longer battery life
   - Game will automatically reduce graphics quality
3. **Use landscape orientation** for optimal view
4. **Good lighting** helps with touch controls visibility

### Expected Performance:
- iPhone 12 or newer: 60 FPS
- iPhone X to 11: 45-60 FPS
- iPhone 8 or older: 30-45 FPS

## Development Notes

### Graphics Backend
- The game uses **Metal** on iOS (not OpenGL)
- Current implementation uses stub/placeholder rendering
- Full Metal rendering can be implemented in `Renderer.cpp`

### Future Enhancements
To add full Metal rendering:
1. Implement Metal render pipeline in `Renderer.cpp`
2. Add Metal shaders (.metal files)
3. Update shader compilation in `Shader.cpp`
4. See `/ios/GameViewController.mm` for Metal device setup

### Project Structure
