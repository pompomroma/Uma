## How to Build for iOS

### On macOS (Recommended):
```bash
# Make sure Xcode is installed
./build_ios.sh

# Or for debug build
./build_ios.sh Debug
```

### Manual Xcode Build:
```bash
cd ios
cmake -B build -G Xcode -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.0
open build/RacingGame3DiOS.xcodeproj
```
