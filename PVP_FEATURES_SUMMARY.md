   - Player stat updates
   - Ability cooldowns
   - Projectile updates
   - Collision detection
   - Resource regeneration
3. **Rendering**:

## üí° Usage Examples

### Attacking
```cpp
// Laser attack at target
Vector3 targetPos = enemy->getPosition();
player->performLaserAttack(targetPos);

// Melee attack
player->performFistAttack();

// Ultimate ability
player->performUltimateAttack();
```

### Defense
```cpp
// Activate shield
player->activateShield();

// Deactivate when done
player->deactivateShield();

// Check if shielding
if (player->isShieldActive()) {
    // Shield is up
}
```

### Mobility
```cpp
// Teleport forward
player->teleportInDirection(player->getForward(), 15.0f);

// Teleport to specific position
player->teleportToPosition(targetPos);

// Check if can teleport
if (player->canTeleport()) {
    // Has charges and stamina
}
```

### Stats
```cpp
// Spend stat point
player->spendStatPoint("strength");

// Gain experience
player->gainExperience(100.0f);

// Get current stats
const auto& stats = player->getStats();
int level = stats.level;
float health = stats.currentHealth;
```

## üìù Notes

- All PVP features are fully integrated with the game loop
- Collision detection is basic but functional (sphere-based)
- UI rendering is placeholder (needs proper 2D system)
- Text rendering needs font library integration
- Balance values may need tuning through playtesting
- Networking not implemented but architecture supports it

## ‚ú® Highlights

This implementation adds a complete RPG-style combat system to the racing game, creating a unique hybrid genre. Players can:
- Level up and customize stats
- Use multiple attack abilities
- Defend with shields
- Teleport for tactical positioning
- All while racing around the track!

The system is modular, extensible, and ready for further development.
