## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Platform Detection
```cpp
#if PLATFORM_IOS
    // iOS-specific code (Metal, UIKit)
#else
    // Desktop code (OpenGL, GLFW)
#endif
```

### Preserved Desktop Builds
- ✅ Desktop builds work exactly as before
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ All OpenGL code intact
- ✅ Original functionality 100% preserved

### iOS-Specific
- Uses Metal for graphics (stubs currently)
- Uses UIKit for windowing
- Uses touch for input
- Includes iOS frameworks automatically

## 🎯 Next Steps

### To Play on Your iPhone

1. Access a Mac computer
2. Transfer this project
3. Run `./build_ios.sh`
4. Open in Xcode
5. Connect iPhone
6. Build & Run!

See **QUICKSTART_IOS.md** for the exact steps.

### To Enhance Graphics (Optional)

The rendering currently uses stubs for iOS. To add full Metal rendering:
