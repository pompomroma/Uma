# Quick Setup Guide for Uma Racing

## What You Need to Install

### 1. Xcode (Required)
- **Download**: Mac App Store → Search "Xcode" → Install
- **Size**: ~15GB download
- **Time**: 30-60 minutes depending on internet speed
- **Why**: Compiles C++ code for iOS and provides iOS Simulator

### 2. Homebrew (Package Manager)
```bash
# Install Homebrew (if not already installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### 3. CMake (Build System)
```bash
# Install CMake via Homebrew
brew install cmake
```

### 4. Apple Developer Account (Free or Paid)
- **Free Account**: Can run on simulator and your own device (7-day certificates)
- **Paid Account ($99/year)**: Required for App Store distribution
- **Setup**: Xcode → Preferences → Accounts → Add Apple ID

```

### iOS Platform Files (iOS-specific code)
```

```

## Step-by-Step Build Process

### Step 1: Open Terminal in Your Project Folder
```bash
cd /path/to/your/uma-racing-project
```

### Step 2: Set Your Developer Team ID
1. Open `CMakeLists.txt` in a text editor
2. Find line: `set(CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM "YOUR_TEAM_ID")`
3. Replace `YOUR_TEAM_ID` with your actual Team ID

**How to find your Team ID:**
- Open Xcode
- Go to Xcode → Preferences → Accounts
- Select your Apple ID
- Your Team ID is shown next to your name

### Step 3: Run Build Script
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x build_ios.sh

# Run the build script
./build_ios.sh
```

### Step 4: Open in Xcode
```bash
# This opens the generated Xcode project
open build/ios/UmaRacing.xcodeproj
```

### Step 5: Configure Project in Xcode
1. **Select the project** (top item in left sidebar)
2. **Select "UmaRacing" target** (under TARGETS)
3. **Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab**
4. **Team**: Select your development team
5. **Bundle Identifier**: Change to something unique like `com.yourname.umaracing`

### Step 6: Choose Device/Simulator
- Top of Xcode window: Click device dropdown
- Choose your connected iPhone, or
- Choose "iPhone 15" simulator (or any iOS simulator)

### Step 7: Build and Run
- Press **Cmd+R** or click the ▶️ play button
- Wait for compilation (1-3 minutes first time)
- Game launches on your device/simulator

## Game Features Explained

### Camera System
- **File**: `src/engine/Camera.cpp`
- **What it does**: Smoothly follows the player character from behind
- **Effects**: Shakes when dashing, automatically adjusts to player movement

### Player Movement
- **File**: `src/game/Player.cpp`
- **Controls**: 
  - Touch and drag to move
  - Long swipe to dash
  - Automatic running animation
- **States**: Idle → Running → Dashing → Jumping → Falling

### Racing Mechanics
- **File**: `src/game/Game.cpp`
- **Features**:
  - Checkpoint system (yellow markers)
  - Race timer
  - Speed-based visual effects
  - Touch to start racing

### Visual Effects
- **Files**: `src/shaders/basic.frag`
- **Effects**:
  - Speed glow (blue effect when moving fast)
  - Dash trail (orange trail when dashing)
  - Dynamic lighting
  - Camera shake

## Customizing the Game

### Change Player Speed
Edit `src/game/Player.h`:
```cpp
float runSpeed = 15.0f;    // Make player run faster
float dashSpeed = 30.0f;   // Make dash more powerful
```

### Change Camera Behavior
Edit `src/engine/Camera.h`:
```cpp
Vec3 offset(0, 8, 15);     // Camera further back and higher
float followSpeed = 3.0f;  // Slower, more cinematic camera
```

### Change Visual Effects
Edit `src/shaders/basic.frag`:
```glsl
vec3 speedGlow = vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0) * speedEffect * 0.5; // Red speed glow
```

### Add New Objects
Edit `src/game/Game.cpp` in the `render()` function:
```cpp
// Add a new cube at position (10, 1, 5)
Transform newObjectTransform;
newObjectTransform.position = Vec3(10, 1, 5);
renderObject(*playerMesh, newObjectTransform, Vec3(0, 1, 0)); // Green cube
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Build Failed" - Code Signing Error
- **Problem**: No development team selected
- **Solution**: Follow Step 5 above to set your team and bundle ID

### "No iOS Destination Available"
- **Problem**: No simulator or device selected
- **Solution**: Install iOS Simulator via Xcode → Preferences → Components

### Game Runs But No Touch Input
- **Problem**: Touch handling not working
- **Solution**: Make sure you're testing on device or simulator, not macOS

### Low Frame Rate
- **Problem**: Game running slowly
- **Solution**: 
  - Test on device instead of simulator
  - Reduce mesh complexity in `Mesh.cpp`
  - Lower visual effects in shaders

### Can't Find Team ID
- **Problem**: Don't have Apple Developer account
- **Solution**: 
  - Sign up at developer.apple.com (free account works)
  - Add your Apple ID in Xcode Preferences

## Testing on Your iPhone

### Requirements
- iPhone running iOS 12.0 or later
- Lightning/USB-C cable to connect to Mac
- Trust the developer certificate on your iPhone

### Steps
1. Connect iPhone to Mac with cable
2. On iPhone: Settings → General → Device Management → Trust your developer certificate
3. In Xcode: Select your iPhone from device dropdown
4. Build and run (Cmd+R)
